# Euclidian

Euclidian is an experiment that may (hopefully) become a full fledged project.
The goal is to have a set of simple, easy to use drawing tools for use while studying Euclidian geometry
from the original source (Euclid's Elements).

This means the drawing tools are meant to be strictly derived from the postulates of Book I of the Elements. 
Everything is centered around drawing figures quickly and cleanly, and any other tools will be
aids to understanding Euclid's proofs (color coding different shapes, labeling points and lines, etc.)
